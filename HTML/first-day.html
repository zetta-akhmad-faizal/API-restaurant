            I'm a person who is a like learn. Currently, i interested to learn Back-end Dev roadmap <br>
            I have followed some activity like <strong>Intensive Learning as Back-End Developer</strong> from DSC Jogja Festival <br>
            And then i followed several mini project like Vote-Apps V2, and ShortenLink and i was assigned in Back-End Dev Team <br>
            Then i registered to Bangkit Academy as Cloud Computing cohort, in this activity my final project's <strong>Price Optimization</strong> <br>
            from Traveloka Singapore. I was assigned in Back-End Dev team too. But during my activity, i only used Python stack, MySQL for DB, and GCP for deployment.<br>
            I haven't ever to NodeJS and used GraphQL or MongoDB for DB to project. So, now i following <strong>Zettacamp Batch 3</strong> as Back-End Dev <br>
